# Introduction

## What is Survival Analysis

- Survival analysis, survival times, factors influencing survival times

## What you need to know to use this book

## Survival Data and Censoring

- response variable, time-to-event, is a non-negative discrete or continuous random variable
- censoring, right censoring, results when the final endpoint is only known to exceed a particular value

- $T^*$ is a random variable representing the time to failure
- U is a random variable representing the time to a censoring event
- what we observe is $T=min(T^*,U)$ and a censoring indicator $\delta=I[T^*<U]$. $\delta$ is 0 when T is a censored time, or 1 when T is observed.

right-censoring, left-censoring (less common)

Three types:
- Type I, the censoring times are pre-specified
- Type II, follow-up stops when a pre-specified fraction have failed
- Random. Patient dropout. Competing events. Administrative censoring.

Example 1.1. clinial trail; accural period + follow-up period

administrative censoring; patient dropout: non-informative (unrelated) vs informative (related to the failure process)

The goals of surivival analysis

- estimate the survival distribution
- compare two or more survival distributions
- assess the effects of a number of factors on survival

## Some examples of survival data sets

Example 1.2. Xelox (chemotherapy drug) in patients with advanced gastric (胃) cancer

Progression-free survival: the time from entry into the clinical trial until progression or death, whichever comes first

Wang et al. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol 2014

```{r}
#install.packages("asaur")
library(asaur)
gastricXelox[23:27,]
```

Example 1.3 Pancreatic cancer (胰腺癌) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease

Moss et al., Gastrointest. Cancer Res. 2012

```{r}
head(pancreatic)

### stage column: M means metastatic; LA means locally advanced
```

Example 1.4 survival prospects of prostate cancer patients (前列腺癌) with high-risk disease

Lu-Yao et al., J. Am. Med. Assoc, 2009

```{r}
prostateSurvival[88:95,]
### grade: poorly or moderately differentiated
### cancer stage: T1c if screen-diagnosed using a prostate-specific antigen blood test, T1ab if clinically diagnosed without screening, or T2 if palpable at diagnosis
### surival time: days from diagnosis to death or date last seen
### status: 1 if died of prostate cancer, 2 if died of some other cause, or 0 still alive at the date last seen
```

Example 1.5 Comparison of medical therapies to aid smokers to quit

triple-mdication combination vs therapy with the nicotine patch alone

time from randomization until relapse (return to smoking); censored at six months

Steinberg Ann. Intern. Med 2009

```{r}
pharmacoSmoking[1:6, 2:8]
# ttr: time to relapse/the number of days without smoking
# employment: ft (full time), pt (part time), or other
```

Example 1.6 Prediction of survival of hepatocellular carcinoma (肝细胞癌) patients using biomarkers

```{r}
hepatoCellular[c(1,2,3,65,71),c(2,3,16:20,24,47)]
# OS: overall survival
# RFS: recurrence-free survival
