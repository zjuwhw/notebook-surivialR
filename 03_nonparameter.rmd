# Nonparametric Survival Curve Estimation

## Nonparametric Estimation of the Survival Function

product-limit estimator/Kaplan-Meier estimator (Kaplan and Meier, 1958): the product over the failure times of the conditional probabilities of surviving to the next failure time,

$$\hat{S}(t)=\prod_{t_i \le t}(1-\hat{q}_i) = \prod_{t_i \le t}(1-\frac{d_i}{n_i})$$

, where

- $n_i$ is the number of subjects at risk at time $t_i$
- $d_i$ is the number of individuals who fail at that time.

Back to example 1.1

The median survival time is at t=6, which is the smallest time t such that S(t)<=0.5.

Based on "delta method", the sampling variance of $log(\hat{S}(t))$,

$$var(log \hat{S}(t))=\sum_{t_i \le t}var(log(1-\hat{q}_i))\approx \sum_{t_i \le t}\frac{d_i}{n_i(n_i-d_i)}$$

Use the delta method again,

$$var(\hat{S}(t)) \approx [\hat{S}(t)]^2\sum_{t_i \le t}\frac{d_i}{n_i(n_i-d_i)}$$

Another (more satisfying) approach is via the complementary log-log transformation of $\hat{S}(t)$

$$var(log[-log \hat{S}(t)]) \approx \frac{1}{[log \hat{S}(t)]^2}\sum_{t_i \le t}\frac{d_i}{n_i(n_i-d_i)}$$

```{r}
library(survival)
time = c(7,6,6,5,2,4)
status=c(0,1,0,0,1,1)
Surv(time, status)

result.km = survfit(Surv(time, status)~1)
result.km
summary(result.km)


## the default value for conf.type option is "log"
result.km2 = survfit(Surv(time, status)~1, conf.type="log-log")
summary(result.km2)

layout(matrix(1:2,1,2))
plot(result.km, main="log")
plot(result.km2, main="log-log")
```

An alternative estimator of the survival function is Nelson-Aalen estimator/Fleming and Harrington, based on the relationship of the survival function to the hazard function

$$S(t)=e^{-H(t)}\text{ and } H(t)=\sum_{t_i \le t}\frac{d_i}{n_i}$$

```{r}
result.fh = survfit(Surv(time, status)~1, conf.type="log-log", type="fh")
summary(result.fh)
```

Back to example 1.2

```{r}
library(asaur)
timeMonths = gastricXelox$timeWeeks * 7 /30.25
delta = gastricXelox$delta
result.km = survfit(Surv(timeMonths, delta)~1, conf.type="log-log")
plot(result.km, conf.int=T, mark="|", xlab="Time in months", ylab="Survival probability",
     main="Progression-free survival in gastric cancer patients")
```

## Finding the median survival and a confidence interval for the median
 
Formally, the median survival time is defined as $\hat{t}_{med}=inf\{t: \hat{S}(t) \le 0.5\}$. That is the smallest t such that the survival function is less than or equal to 0.5.
 
To find a $1-\alpha$ confidence interval for the median, we consider the following inequality:
 
$$-z_{\alpha/2}\le \frac{g(\hat{S}(t))-g(0.5)}{\sqrt{var[g(\hat{S}(t))]}} \le z_{\alpha/2}$$
 
, where $g(u)=log[-log(u)]$ and $var[g(\hat{S}(t))]$ has been given above
 
```{r}
result.km
plot(result.km)
abline(h=0.5, col="red", lty=2)
segments(x0 = 10.3, y0 = -1, x1 = 10.3, y1 = 0.5, col = "green", lty = 2)
segments(x0 = 5.79, y0 = -1, x1 = 5.79, y1 = 0.5, col = "blue", lty = 2)
segments(x0 = 15.3, y0 = -1, x1 = 15.3, y1 = 0.5, col = "blue", lty = 2)
```

## Median Follow-up Time

A simple definition is to consider all of the survival times

A perhaps better way is to first switch the censoring and death indicators, and then computes the KM estimate. This method is also known as the "reverse" Kaplan-Meier.

```{r}
delta.followup = 1-delta
survfit(Surv(timeMonths, delta.followup)~1)
```
